# Data Analysis - Techfest 2025

<h2>üîé Problem: Two Realities</h2> 
<p align="justify">
In 2023, Indonesia's regional financial management presents a paradox. On one hand, many regional governments have showcased remarkable efficiency, with a minimal gap between the budget ceiling and its realization. On the other, the needle on the Human Development Index (HDI) has barely moved.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This project seeks to answer the critical question: If the money is being spent, why aren't we seeing a proportional improvement in the quality of life for all citizens?
</p>

<h2>üìä Data: Following the Money</h2>
<p align="justify">
To investigate this, we analyzed a comprehensive dataset of Indonesia's regional finances, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Transfer ke Daerah dan Dana Desa (TKDD)</b>: Regional Transfer and Village Funds, including budget ceilings and realization.</li>
  <li><b>Socio-Economic Indicators:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Population Size</li>
      <li>Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita</li>
      <li>Poverty Rates</li>
      <li>Human Development Index (HDI)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Analysis: From Raw Numbers to Revealing Insights</h2> 
<p align="justify">
Our analysis was a multi-step journey to uncover the story hidden within the data:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:</b> Ensuring the data was accurate and ready for analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Using visualizations to identify initial trends, patterns, and anomalies.</li>
  <li><b>Statistical Modeling:</b> Building models to understand the relationships between financial data and socio-economic outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
The core of our analysis was to test the hypothesis that higher budget realization directly leads to a higher HDI.
</p>

<h2>üí° Key Findings: The Great Disconnect</h2> 
<p align="justify">
Our analysis revealed a situation that demands a shift in perspective:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>The Efficiency Trap:</b> Budget allocation is heavily skewed towards regions with larger populations and stronger economies, rather than those with the most urgent development needs. This creates a cycle where wealthier regions get wealthier, while underserved regions struggle to catch up.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Money Isn't Everything:</b> The size of the budget does not have a significant impact on increasing the Human Development Index (HDI). Instead, factors like GRDP per capita and poverty rates are far more influential.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The Real Levers of Change:</b> The most impactful way to improve human development is not just to spend more money, but to use it to directly address poverty and increase the purchasing power of the community.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p align="justify">
The main takeaway from this analysis is clear and urgent: <b>what matters most is not how much money is spent, but how effectively it is used</b>.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
  To achieve equitable and inclusive development across Indonesia, there must be a fundamental policy shift. The focus must move from the mere efficiency of fund absorption to the <b>tangible, life-improving impacts</b> felt by communities, especially in the most disadvantaged areas.
</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Needs-Based Budgeting:</b> Revamp the budget allocation formula to prioritize regions with higher poverty rates and lower HDI scores.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Outcome-Oriented Policies:</b> Design programs that are directly aimed at alleviating poverty and increasing people's purchasing power.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data-Driven Governance:</b> Continuously monitor and evaluate the impact of spending on real-world outcomes, not just on spreadsheets
  </li>
</ul>
